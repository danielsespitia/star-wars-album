## Getting Started 
To run this project it is necessary to have Node.js installed on your machine.

To run the app, you have to install its dependencies first by running one of the following commands: `yarn install` or `npm install`. Once the dependencies installation is done, you will be able to run the app with the commands `yarn start` or `npm start` in your web browser.

You can also run the written unit tests with `yarn test` or `npm test` and the integration and E2E tests with `yarn e2e` or `npm e2e` to open the Cypress' Electron App and watch the live demo of the tests or you can run `yarn cypress run` or `npm cypress run` to run the tests in your Terminal.
